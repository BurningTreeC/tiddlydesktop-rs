    <h1 id="privacy-policy">I. Privacy Policy for TiddlyDesktop-RS</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: March 1, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>TiddlyDesktop-RS ("we", "our", or "the app") is an open-source application for viewing and editing TiddlyWiki files. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect any personal data. No data is ever transmitted to any server unless you explicitly opt in to the optional sync features described below.</strong></p>
    <p>TiddlyDesktop-RS is designed to work locally on your device. The app:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Does not collect personal information</li>
        <li>Does not track your usage</li>
        <li>Does not use analytics services</li>
        <li>Does not use advertising</li>
        <li>Does not transmit any data to external servers unless you explicitly enable optional sync features</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>TiddlyDesktop-RS stores the following data locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Wiki Files:</strong> Your TiddlyWiki files are stored in locations you choose on your device's storage.</li>
        <li><strong>Recent Wikis List:</strong> A list of recently opened wikis is stored locally to provide quick access.</li>
        <li><strong>Favicon Cache:</strong> Extracted favicon images from your wikis are cached locally for display in the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Backup Files:</strong> If backups are enabled, copies of your wiki files are stored locally.</li>
        <li><strong>Sync Configuration:</strong> If you enable sync features, connection settings (device name, room codes, encrypted passwords, and encrypted authentication tokens) are stored locally on your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All locally stored data remains on your device and is never transmitted elsewhere unless you explicitly enable sync features.</p>

    <h2>Optional Sync Features (Opt-In Only)</h2>
    <p><strong>The following features are entirely optional and disabled by default. No data leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to enable them.</strong></p>

    <h3>LAN Sync</h3>
    <p>When you enable LAN Sync, the app discovers and communicates with other TiddlyDesktop-RS devices on your local network to synchronize wiki content. All communication stays within your local network and does not pass through any external servers. Wiki content is encrypted end-to-end between devices.</p>

    <h3>Relay Sync</h3>
    <p>When you enable Relay Sync, the app can synchronize wiki content between devices over the internet via a relay server. This feature requires you to log in with a supported authentication provider (GitHub or Google) and involves the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>GitHub Authentication:</strong> When you choose to log in with GitHub, the app initiates a standard OAuth authorization flow. Your GitHub username and user ID are shared with the relay server to verify your identity and manage room membership. We only request the <code>read:user</code> scope and do not access your repositories, email, or any other GitHub data beyond your public username and ID.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Authentication:</strong> When you choose to log in with Google, the app initiates a standard OpenID Connect (OIDC) authorization flow. Your Google display name and unique user ID are shared with the relay server to verify your identity and manage room membership. We only request the <code>openid</code> and <code>profile</code> scopes and do not access your email, contacts, files, or any other Google data beyond your public display name and ID.</li>
        <li><strong>Relay Server:</strong> The relay server (<code>relay.tiddlydesktop-rs.com</code>) facilitates message passing between your devices. Room membership data (usernames associated with rooms) is stored on the relay server.</li>
        <li><strong>End-to-End Encryption:</strong> All wiki content transmitted through the relay server is end-to-end encrypted using a password-derived key that only you and your room members know. The relay server cannot read your wiki content.</li>
        <li><strong>Token Storage:</strong> Your authentication access token (GitHub or Google) is stored locally on your device, encrypted at rest using a device-specific key. It is never stored in plaintext.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Network Access</h2>
    <p>The app uses network access for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Running a local web server for folder-based TiddlyWiki wikis (localhost only)</li>
        <li>Loading local wiki content in the WebView component (localhost only)</li>
        <li>Checking for app updates (a single request to GitHub to compare version numbers)</li>
        <li>LAN Sync device discovery and communication (local network only, opt-in)</li>
        <li>Relay Sync communication with the relay server (internet, opt-in)</li>
        <li>GitHub or Google OAuth authentication (internet, opt-in)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>TiddlyDesktop-RS does not use any analytics platforms or advertising networks. The following third-party services are used only when you explicitly opt in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>GitHub OAuth:</strong> Used as an optional authentication provider for the relay server. Subject to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub's Privacy Statement</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Google OAuth (OpenID Connect):</strong> Used as an optional authentication provider for the relay server. Subject to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Relay Server:</strong> Operated by the TiddlyDesktop-RS project. Stores room membership data only. Cannot access your wiki content (end-to-end encrypted).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local data:</strong> Stored until you delete it or uninstall the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Relay server data:</strong> Room membership records are stored until a room owner deletes the room. Authentication tokens are cached on the relay server for up to 5 minutes for validation purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.</p>

    <h2>Open Source</h2>
    <p>TiddlyDesktop-RS is open-source software. You can review the source code to verify our privacy practices at: <a href="https://github.com/BurningTreeC/TiddlyDesktopRust" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/BurningTreeC/TiddlyDesktopRust</a></p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
