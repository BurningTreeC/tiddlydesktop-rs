! TiddlyDesktop-RS Commands Plugin

This plugin provides action widgets for executing shell commands when running in [[TiddlyDesktop-RS|https://github.com/BurningTreeC/tiddlydesktop-rs]].

!! Requirements

This plugin only works when your wiki is opened in TiddlyDesktop-RS. It has no effect in browsers or other TiddlyWiki hosts.

!! Action Widget: `<$action-run-command>`

Executes a shell command or script.

!!! Attributes

|!Attribute |!Description |!Default |
|`$command` |Command or script path to run (required) |- |
|`$args` |Arguments (space-separated, supports quoted strings) |- |
|`$workingDir` |Working directory for the command |- |
|`$wait` |Wait for completion and capture output (`yes`/`no`) |`no` |
|`$confirm` |Show confirmation dialog before running (`yes`/`no`) |`yes` |
|`$outputTiddler` |Tiddler to store command output (requires `$wait="yes"`) |- |
|`$outputField` |Field for stdout |`text` |
|`$exitCodeField` |Field for exit code |- |
|`$stderrField` |Field for stderr |- |

!!! Examples

!!!! Simple command (with confirmation)

```
<$button>
  Open File Manager
  <$action-run-command $command="xdg-open" $args="."/>
</$button>
```

!!!! Run without confirmation

Use `$confirm="no"` only for trusted commands:

```
<$action-run-command $command="notify-send" $args="'Hello World'" $confirm="no"/>
```

!!!! Capture output

```
<$button>
  Get Date
  <$action-run-command
    $command="date"
    $wait="yes"
    $outputTiddler="$:/temp/date-output"
    $exitCodeField="exit_code"
  />
</$button>

Output: {{$:/temp/date-output}}
```

!! Security

* ''Confirmation dialog'': By default, a native dialog asks the user to approve each command
* Set `$confirm="no"` only for trusted commands you control
* Commands run with your user permissions
