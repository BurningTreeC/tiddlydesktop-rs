! CodeMirror 6 Collaborative Editing

This plugin enables real-time collaborative editing when using CodeMirror 6 as your text editor and TiddlyDesktop's Sync feature.

!! Requirements

* TiddlyDesktop-RS with Sync enabled
* CodeMirror 6 editor plugin installed
* At least two devices in the same sync room

!! How it works

When two or more devices have the same wiki synced via TiddlyDesktop Sync and edit the same tiddler simultaneously, this plugin enables real-time collaborative editing using [[Yjs|https://yjs.dev/]] (a CRDT library). Changes are merged automatically without conflicts.

!! Features

* Real-time text synchronization between editors
* Cursor and selection awareness (see where others are editing)
* Automatic conflict resolution via Yjs CRDT
* Works with all TiddlyWiki content types supported by CodeMirror 6
